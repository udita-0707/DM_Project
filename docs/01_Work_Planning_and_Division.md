# Work Planning and Division

This document outlines our structured plan as a three-person team, defining clear role assignments, responsibilities, and knowledge exchange strategies to address the **Work Planning and Division** evaluation criterion (15 Marks).

## 1. Team Roles and Responsibilities

We have divided the project into three core roles to maximize expertise and ensure clear ownership of deliverables:

| Role | Core Responsibilities | Key Deliverables |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Pre-processing Lead** | Data acquisition, cleaning, transformation, and quality assurance. | `arxiv_dataset.py`, `arxiv_processed.csv`, Data cleaning documentation |
| **Research & Analysis Lead** | Exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, and statistical validation. | `exploratory_analysis.py`, Analysis results, Research methodology documentation |
| **Visualization & Dashboard Lead** | Web dashboard development and interactive visualizations. | `app.py`, `index.html`, Final dashboard |

## 2. Knowledge Exchange Strategy

We will implement a knowledge exchange strategy to ensure all members understand the entire project:

### Daily Stand-ups (15 min)
Each member reports progress, blockers, and planned tasks.

### Weekly Deep Dive (1 hour)
- **Week 1:** Data Pre-processing Lead presents data cleaning pipeline
- **Week 2:** Research & Analysis Lead presents analysis findings and hypotheses
- **Week 3:** Visualization Lead presents dashboard architecture

### Leadership Rotation (Bi-weekly)
Team Lead responsibilities rotate every two weeks:
- Facilitates stand-ups and deep dives
- Reviews pull requests and ensures clean Git history
- Coordinates final report and presentation

| Period | Team Lead |
| :--- | :--- |
| Week 1-2 | Data Pre-processing Lead |
| Week 3-4 | Research & Analysis Lead |
| Week 5-6 | Visualization & Dashboard Lead |

## 3. Tracking and Consistency

We will use GitHub for tracking:
- **Git Commits:** Frequent commits with clear messages using prefixes: `FEAT:`, `FIX:`, `DATA:`, `DOCS:`, `VIZ:`
- **Project Board:** GitHub Project Board to track tasks, assignees, and deadlines
